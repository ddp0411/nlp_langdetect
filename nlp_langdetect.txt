Language detection and translation in NLP
1] Install google translator:(paste the below code in your terminal)
    pip install google_trans_translator
2] Install language detector:(paste the below code in your terminal)
    pip install langdetect


This code defines a function called detect_and_translate that takes two arguments: text (a string representing the text to be translated) and target_lang (a string representing the target language for translation).

Within the function:

1] It uses the detect function from the langdetect library to determine the language of the input text.
2] If the detected language matches the target language, it returns the input text without translation.
3] If the detected language is different from the target language, it initializes a translator object from the google_translator library and translates the input text 
   from the detected language to the target language.
4] It returns the translated text.
After defining the function, the code provides a sample sentence and calls the detect_and_translate function with this sentence and the target language 
set to 'sw' (which typically represents Swahili). 
The function detects the language of the sentence, translates it into Swahili (if necessary), and prints the translated text.
